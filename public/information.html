                <p class="body">COVID-19 and its variants have the potential to cause significant damage to the wider South Australian community.
                In response to this threat the Chief Health officer has administered that this COVID Tracing
                Application be put in place to insure the safety of the Community.</p>
                <h3 class ="body">COVID-19â€™s Risks to the Community</h3>
                <p class = "body">COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease that can have a wide variety of affects on an individual.
                An infection can lead to sever long term health outcomes such as fatigue and chronic mussel pain, as well as death.
                Symptoms of a COVID-19 infection include dry cough, fatigue, and fever. Some individuals may experience no signs or symptoms of the disease
                and have no negative health outcomes whatsoever. Due to this disparity in indications of infection COVID-19 can be extremely
                hard to detect in the community before it is spread more widely. For more information on COVID-19 please refer to SA Health website. </p>
                <h3 class = "body">Purpose of COVID-19 Tracing Application</h3>
                <p class = "body">As highlighted above COVID-19 can spread undetected within the community for extended periods of time before being
                detected through testing. When a case is detected the areas in which they have been whilst infectious are recorded from the tracing app
                and distributed to the public. The public is then advised if they have been to any of the locations at which a person has been infection,
                then they should immediately isolate and get tested. This allows health authorities to rapidly respond to any outbreaks of the virus which
                may occur. The wide adoption and use of a COVID-19 tracing app allows more normal activity to occur whilst also keep the community as
                safe as possible.</p>
